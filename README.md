# Machine Learning Starter Kit 🚀

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Starter Kit**! This repository provides a foundational framework to kickstart your journey into machine learning using Python's scikit-learn library. Whether you're just starting out, looking for a quick implementation, or seeking a refresher, this kit offers the essentials to define, train, and evaluate machine learning models.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Before diving in, ensure you've installed the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

## 🔍 Defining Features and Labels

Define your features (`X`) and labels (`y`). For instance:

```python
X = df[["your_features_go_here"]]
y = df["your_label_goes_here"]
```

Replace placeholders with your actual column names.

## 🔪 Splitting Data

Data is divided into training and testing sets. 80% is used for training, and 20% for testing.

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

🤖 **Defining Models and Experimenting with Hyperparameters**

Below, we've provided a set of models with different hyperparameters. These models serve as a starting point for your machine learning journey:

Each have `max_depth` and `min_samples_split` adjustments and some are default

- **Decision Tree**
  
- **Random Forest**
  
- **Gradient Boosting**

```python
models = {
    "Decision Tree": DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42),
    "Decision Tree 2": DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=5, min_samples_split=10, random_state=42),

    "Random Forest": RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42),
    "Random Forest 2": RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42, min_samples_split=10, max_depth=5),

    "Gradient Boosting": GradientBoostingClassifier(random_state=42, min_samples_split=10, max_depth=5),
}
```

Feel free to tweak these hyperparameters, add new ones, or introduce other models from scikit-learn. Experimentation is key to finding the best model for your data!

## 📊 Model Evaluation Function

The `evaluate_model` function is central to this kit. It:

1. **Trains** the model.
2. **Predicts** on training, testing, and full datasets.
3. **Evaluates** performance using metrics like accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score.
4. **Returns** these metrics.

This function works with any scikit-learn model.

## 📈 Model Evaluation

Each model is trained and its performance metrics are calculated using the `evaluate_model` function.

```python
results = []
for name, model in models.items():
    ...
```

## 📊 Results

After evaluation, results are stored in a DataFrame for easy viewing.

```python
results_df.head()
```

📢 **Tip**: Always experiment with different models and hyperparameters to achieve the best results!
